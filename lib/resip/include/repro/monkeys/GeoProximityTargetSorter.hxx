  If enabled, then this baboon can post-process the target list.  
  This includes targets from the StaticRoute monkey and/or targets
  from the LocationServer monkey.  Requests that meet the filter 
  criteria will have their Target list, flatened (serialized) and
  ordered based on the proximity of the target to the client sending
  the request.  Proximity is determined by looking for a 
  x-repro-geolocation="<latitude>,<longitude>" parameter on the Contact
  header of a received request, or the Contact headers of Registration
  requests.  If this parameter is not found, then this processor will
  attempt to determine the public IP address closest to the client or
  target and use the MaxMind Geo IP library to lookup the geo location.

  There are several requirements for using this Processor/Baboon:
  1.  RESIP_FIXED_POINT preprocessor define is required to allow floating
      point operations required for distance calculations.
  2.  USE_MAXMIND_GEOIP preprocessor define is required to allow linking
      with the MaxMind Geo IP library for looking up lat/long information
      for an IP address.
  3.  A copy of the GeoIP City database is required for looking up lat/long
      information for an IP address.  A free version of the databases can 
      be downloaded from here:
      http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
      and here (v6):
      http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCityv6-beta/
      For a more accurate database, please see the details here:
      http://www.maxmind.com/app/city
      The location of these files are specifed in the following setting2:
      GeoProximityIPv4CityDatabaseFile and GeoProximityIPv6CityDatabaseFile
  4.  A request URI filter must be defined in the repro configuration.  This
      filter uses a PCRE compliant regular expression to attempt
      to match against the request URI of inbound requests.  Any requests
      matching this expression, will have its Targets sorted as described
      above.
      ie: GeoProximityRequestUriFilter = ^sip:mediaserver.*@mydomain.com$

   Some additional settings are:
   GeoProximityDefaultDistance - The distance (in Kilometers) to use for 
      proximity sorting, when the Geo Location of a target cannot be 
      determined. 

   LoadBalanceEqualDistantTargets - If enabled, then targets that are 
      determined to be of equal distance from the client, will be placed in 
      a random order.
